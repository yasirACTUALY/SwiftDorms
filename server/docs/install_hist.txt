  # this is an interactive commmand. It will request the domain you want to secure, and an email
  # (I did not provide my email as you can see). It also requires agreement to their TOS:
  # https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.4-April-3-2024.pdf which I skimmed-- didn't see
  # anything I'm necessarily worried about. I think. Some email needs to be registered with them later
  # though or else they may revoke the CA without us noticing.
sudo certbot --register-unsafely-without-email --nginx

  # for whatever reason the above command didn't work. It fails with an error because our domain is
  # only valid inside of the rpi network, and therefore it fails validation/safety checks made by
  # Let's Encrypt however this suggests there is a solution: 
  # https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/can-letsencrypt-support-a-use-case-where-a-webserver-does-not-allow-inbound-public-connectivity/227682/4
  # but I don't know anything about any of this, so I'm more inclined to believe I should be asking
  # rpi for a cert or something, right? Does that make sense? urgh idk. I'm going to have to ask
  # the other teams if they have set up TLS/SSL certs on rpi servers before and how they did it.
  # there has to be something I'm doing very wrong here.
